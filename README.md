> *"I do MLOps, DevOps, and SRE. Essentially I break things, fix things, and then teach robots to break them faster."*

## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

| Role | What I Actually Do |
|------|--------------------|
| 🤖 **MLOps** | Deploy models that were "99% accurate" in notebooks and watch them hallucinate in prod |
| 🔧 **DevOps** | Automate everything so I can be interrupted by alerts instead of humans |
| 🚨 **SRE** | Write postmortems at 3am. Current streak: **too many** |

## ☁️ My Relationship with Infrastructure

```hcl
resource "shilucloud" "identity" {
  roles         = ["MLOps", "DevOps", "SRE"]
  on_call       = true        # always
  sleep         = false       # see above
  coffee        = "critical"  # lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }
  model_in_prod = "it depends"
  uptime_sla    = "99.9%"    # personal SLA: 60%
}
```

## 🚨 Typical Day as Me

```
08:00 — Write Terraform. Feel like a god.
09:30 — terraform apply. Feel like a fool.
11:00 — ML model is "drifting." So am I.
13:00 — Lunch. Alert fires. Lunch cancelled.
15:00 — Postmortem: "human error." (it was me)
17:00 — Fix it with a pipeline. Ship it. Go home.
02:00 — PagerDuty says otherwise.
```

## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked

- ✅ Secure Terraform pipelines that haven't nuked prod... yet
- ✅ LocalStack: break things locally so prod can break in new creative ways
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines more reliable than my sleep schedule
- ✅ Deployed a model. It was 99% accurate. In the notebook.
- ✅ SLOs I set and SLAs that set me
